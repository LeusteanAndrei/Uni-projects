                <p>The start of Gurren Lagann can be tracked down all the way back to the partnership between Gainax
                    and Aniplex, two of the most influential anime figures of that time. Through the people working on
                    it bringin
                    all sort of innovative ideas, the show turned out to be a love letter to the mecha anime genre,
                    while also creating
                    its own identity.
                    Gainax studios came to be in the 1980's when a group of college students which loved animation
                    and robots made their first succesful animated project, a short film paying omage to the classic
                    mecha anime
                    of that time, which was presented at the 20th Annual Japan National SF Convention, called Daicon IV.
                    First called Daicon Film, the small studio changed its name to Gainax in 1986, the name is formed
                    from an Tottori Prefecture
                    term for the word giant and the suffix 'x' because "it sounded cool".
                </p>
                <img src="style/daicon.jpg" alt="Daicon Film studios">

                <p>
                    It took some time for the studio to really come into its own but it gained its footing with the huge
                    release
                    of Neon Genesis Evangelion in 1995, written and directed by Hideaki Anno. In a very short period of
                    time Evangelion
                    achieved international recognition, captivating the audience with its complex story and
                    philosophical themes. Following
                    the succes of Evangelion, and the questions posed by the show, Hiroyuki Imaishi, (who worked as a
                    lead animator on Eva) started to
                    envision a story that would capture the spirit of the mecha genre, similar in a way to Evangelion
                    but in a totally different way.
                </p>
                <a href="#EvaOP"><img src="style/eva.jpg" alt="Neon Genesis Evangelion poster"></a>

                <p>
                    Evangelion was not just a succesful anime but also a milestone, laying the groundwork for many of
                    the
                    popular tropes to come, inspiring a great number of anime to have deeper meanings. A lot of the
                    staff that
                    would later work on Gurren Lagann, also worked on Evangelion, and this aspect can be seen becaues
                    the two shows
                    are, in a way, two sides of the same coin. Altough radically different in execution, behind all the
                    story and characters,
                    Gurren Lagann and Evangelion both approach the same themes: individuality, consciousness, freedom of
                    choice, responsibility
                    and the search of one's own identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, Gainax has continued to produce many hit anime shows such as Fooly Cooly, Panty and
                    Stocking and many more
                    after it became Studio Trigger( Kill la Kill, Cyberpunk ...). Through all of these shows, a clear
                    attention to style can be remarked,
                    each and everyone of them having their own appeal not just in animation and character design but
                    also in presentation of its story and themes.
                    This is predominantly visible in Gurren Lagann in which every single aspect is approached with the
                    same philosphy at its core: "If you are doing it, I'm doing it. If I don't do it, will you? If you
                    don't do it, I'll do it. I'm doing it so that you'll do it too!!" (Kamina).

            <strong>The story</strong>

            <p>Gurren Lagann takes place in a world where humans are trapped beneath the surface, where humanity lives
                its life in isolated underground villages.
                While digging tunnels to greaten his village, Simon finds a big face and shows it to his "blood brother"
                Kamina. Instantly Simon is portrayed as shy, lacking self-confidence,
                in contrast to Kamina, confident and charistmatic young man, determined to overthrow the status quo.
            </p>

            <img src="style/story/ep1_2.jpg" alt="photo of the sky seen by Simon and Kamina">
            <p>
                In a weird turn of fate, the a giant robot falls upon them destroying the ceiling. Simon and the rest of
                the village are scared, but Kamina is finally excited, this is the moment
                he has been waiting for. Taking his sword in hand and announcing his name, he confidently faces the
                giant behemoth in front of him. In that moment Yoko comes in, a person from the surface,
                with a huge gun. The three of them, Simon, Kamina and Yoko manage to defeath the giant robot, with the
                power of the face found by Simon, and climb up to the surface. There Kamina and Simon
                witness inimaginable beauty as they see the sky for the first time.
            </p>
            <img src="style/story/ep2.jpg" alt="Photo of gurren lagann">
            <p>
                Having reached the surface, the three learn that the ones oppresing humans are beastmen controlling
                giant robots. The first idea that comes to Kamina's mind is to steal the robot and fight back.
                Altough everyone thinks it's stupid, he pushes on with his idea and, with the help of Simon's Lagann, he
                manages to steal a robot, naming it Gurren. This brazen atitude of Kamina
                is a trademark of his character. Later when fighting Viral in his Enkid, a mecha with two faces, Kamina
                gets jealous and wishes he had two face. This is when he proposes the preposterous ideea to combine with
                Simon
                and takes Lagann and shoves it in Gurren's head. Seemingly out of nowhere the two robots start
                combining, forming the newly improved Gurren Lagann.

                    <li>While most mecha anime openings of that time started with a shot illustratin the robot or the
                        protagonist(usually watching the sky), Gurren Lagann's <a href="#TtglOP">Sorairo Days</a>
                        starts of with the charatcers waking up, which further suggests that the show is an affectionate
                        parody of the mecha genre.
                    </li>
                    <li>In classic anime style every single attack is screamed. Many of these attacks have comically

                    <li>Gurren Lagann was released first as an anime but it has gained a number of extra animated shorts
                        and
                        side episodes with the releas of the dvd. This also includes
                        the 15 "Parallel works" music videos, a video manga called Viral's Sweet Dream and a director's
                        cut
                        of episode 6.

                        Ther is also a manga based on the anime which contains some extra content such as Kiyal's
                        comedic
                        rebellion and Yoko attaining her Gunmen.

                        Gurren Laggan was greatly infleunced by the Getter Robo manga, by Ken Ishikawa.
                    </li>
                    <li>About 40% of the show's budget was reserved for the last two episodes to not have the same
                        problems
                        the had with Evangelion.</li>
                    <li>The very first scene was supposed to be a part of ending but was lately scrapped.</li>
                    <li>The shows theme song <a href="#Libera">Libera me from Hell</a> mashes two radically different
                        genres
                        together, opera and rap. The opera part is sung in latin and describes the coming
                        of the end of the world, representing the oppresive force. The rap part represents a rebellious
                        attitude much like team Dai Gurren's. The song played throughout episodes
                        23 and 27 illustrates team Dai Gurren's fight against the anti-spirals.

                            movie in which only Kittan and Kamina day, and the rest of team Dai Gurren continue living.
